# WIP-Cactus
##Current Issues
1. Function download_cactus fails when encountering an error -- this is a large issue when dealing with hundred of variables
2. Universal file path needed

##Solved Issues
1. Tildes in the file path makes it a little easier to use
2. Fixed detection of Greek characters (like alpha and beta)
3. Reformatting -- breaking lines that are too long, renaming variables, etc.
4. Matched unmatched brackets
5. Solved issue with accessing SDF files from cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure

##Added Code
1. Compiling multiple SDFs into 1 file
