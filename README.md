# Status
## Current Issues
1. Reproducibility: transferring the GitHub repo to a new desktop and attempting to re-run the code
2. Adding the full suite of models: currently missing GLM, MARS, GBM, and the ensemble
3. Making a usable .Rmd notebook to run the models

## Most Recent Additions
1. Models: SVM, Random Forest, Cubist, PLS
2. Easy selection of predictors

## Next steps
1. Incorporating the stadard deviation/error evaluation of QSARs
