# WIP-Cactus
##Current Issues
1. Unable to access SDF files from cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure
⋅⋅⋅URL caused a warning: https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure/1-adamantaneacetate/SDF
⋅⋅⋅This is repeated for every single chemical structure
2. Need a more universal file path

##Solved Issues
1. Tildes in the file path makes it a little easier to use
2. Fixed detection of Greek characters (like alpha and beta)
3. Minor reformatting
4. Fixed unmatches brackets
