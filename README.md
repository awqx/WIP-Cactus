# WIP-Cactus
##Current Issues
1. General clean up
2. Variable renaming
3. Create a linear model
4. Make an ACCURATE linear model

##Solved Issues
1. Tildes in the file path makes it a little easier to use
2. Fixed detection of Greek characters (like alpha and beta)
3. Reformatting -- breaking lines that are too long, renaming variables, etc.
4. Matched unmatched brackets
5. Solved issue with accessing SDF files from cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure
6. download.cactus.results can continue past errors and create a dataframe of results

##Added Code
1. Compiling multiple SDFs into 1 file
2. download.cactus.results (see above)
3. Compiling results of download into one table
