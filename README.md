# Status
## Current Issues
1. Updating of all models with new data
2. Feature selection with GF and PLS for combined data

## Most Recent Additions
1. Incorporation of Suzuki into SDF download
2. Download of SDFs within R as well as externally
3. Merging of Rekharsky/Inoue and Suzuki data
4. Combining experimental results with PaDEL-Descriptor predictors

## Near Future Possibilities
1. Chemical descriptor calculation within R with Rcdk
2. Tuning of ANNs and Keras
