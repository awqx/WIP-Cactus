# Models evaluated by standards from Tropsha 2010, DOI: 10.1002/minf201000061
# "Best Practices for QSAR Model Development, Validation, and Exploitation"
# Standards include y-randomization. 

# According Rucker, Rucker, and Meringer in 'y-Randomization and its Variants in
# QSAR/QSOR' (DOI: 10.1021/ci700157b), there are 5 modes of exploring the
# viability of the model using different forms of permutation and randomization.
# For the sake of time, I'll only be using Mode 1: scrambling (permuting) the
# observed DelG (y) values while keeping descriptors the same
